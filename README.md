# Introduction

This project provides a website app to museums or similar organizations. Our first client is the "Mus√©e du Sport" in Nice, France.
The goal of the app is to provide the client an immersive experience with quizzes at the end of a part of the museum to make them learn in a funny way what they just saw and allows the client to share a picture of what he liked the most in the museum. The groupe of visitors can then vote for the picture they liked the most and the Museum can share the most popular picture of a group on Facebook.
In this way, they have memories for ever of their visit of the museum.
Moreover, the application gives to the manager of the museum some detailled statistics of the utilisation of the application, the most liked themes/parts of the museum and if his guides' performances into interesting the clients on the museum's themes/parts.
